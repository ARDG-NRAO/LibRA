v1.0.1: This includes the changes in the code to link with HPG tag v3.0.2, which has the same API as HPG tag v2.0.2 but with type changes, plus a bug fix (in internal CF indexing).  
This version also includes change in how the data bucket is filled, which is used to send data for gridding to HPG.  In this version the data bucket is sized independent of the `casa::VisBuffer` size.  In v1.0.0, the bucket size is an integer multiple of the `casa::VisBuffer`.  The size of the bucket in units of number of visibilities per bucket is determined from the value of the `VBBUCKETSIZE` environment variable, which is set to 20000 by default.
