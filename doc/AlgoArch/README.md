# Algorithm Architecture

## Description


  This document describes a stable and scalable
  architecture for the post processing software with a theoretical
  basis for post-processing algorithms for calibration and imaging of
  interferometric data. The architecture must scale for computing load
  and complexity as well as for continued evolution of algorithms.  On
  the one end this architecture must be rooted firmly in the theory of
  interferometry, optics and signal processing to provide a stable
  basis for a scalable software in terms of computing, development
  costs and inevitable evolution of the algorithms in the future.  On
  the other end, the architecture must be rooted firmly in modern
  scientific software design principles.  Note that the useful design
  principles for scientific software may have significant differences
  from principles for, e.g., non-scientific software development.
