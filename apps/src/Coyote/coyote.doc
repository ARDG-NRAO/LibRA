%%N coyote
	A LibRA app to build a new CFCache, or add CFs to and existing CFCache.

%%A vis (default=)

	The input data base in the MS format.


%%A telescope (default=EVLA)

	Name of the telescope.  This is required to compute the appropriate A-term. 


%%A imsize (default=0)

	Size of the sky-image.


%%A cell (default=0)

	Cell size in arcsec of the sky-image


%%A stokes (default=I) Options:[ I IV]

	Stokes value of the sky-image.


%%A reffreq (default=)

	The reference frequency of the sky image with units (e.g. 3.GHz).


%%A phasecenter (default=)

	Phase center of the sky-image.


%%A wplanes (default=1)

	Number of wterms.


%%A cfcache (default=)

	Name of the output CFCache.  If this does not exist, a new one
	will be created.  If it exists, meta-information from the
	exists CFs will be considered adding new CFs or for filling
	existing ones (mode=fillcf cflist=... below).


%%A wbawp (default=1)

	Parameter to control if the CFs should be frequency dependent.


%%A aterm (default=1)

	Parameter to include (or not) the A-term in the CFs.


%%A psterm (default=0)

	Parameter to include (or not) the PS-term in the CFs.


%%A conjbeams (default=1)

	Parameter to control if the frequency dependence of the PB should be projected out.


%%A muellertype (default=diagonal)

	Mueller matrix type.  Only the "diagonal" is supported for now.


%%A pa (default=-200)

	***This keyword is exposed with a command-line argument of "help=dbg"***

        mode=dryrun:

	   The PA value at which the CFs are computed is determined
	   from the MS for pa > 360.

           For pa value within the [-180,180] range, CFs at the given
           PA value will be constructed.  If an existing CF is found
           that satisfies abs(CF_PA - pa) <= dpa, a new CF will not be
           added or computed.  For pa values that fail this this test,
           new CFs at the given value will be added to the CFCache. 
	
        mode=fillcf:

	   For pa > 360, all existing CFs in the cflist will be
	   filled.  Essentially, pa and dpa settings will be ignored.

           For pa <= 360.0, all CFs in the cflist that satisfy
           abs(CF_PA - pa) <= dpa will be filled.
	   
%%A dpa (default=360)

	The tolerance within which all PA values are considered as
	equivalent to each other.

%%A field (default=)

	The field selection specification for the input MS.


%%A spw (default=)

	The spectral window selection specification for the input MS.


%%A buffersize (default=0)

	Buffer size used to compute the CFs before being trimmed to
	the support size of the CF.  This is not yet used.


%%A oversampling (default=20)

	Oversampling for computing the CF pixels.  This is not yet used.


%%A mode (default=dryrun) Options:[ dryrun fillcf]

	Watched keywords (<VALUE> : <Keywords exposed>):
          fillcf : cflist 

        mode=dryrun will construct empty CFs with only the meta-data
        required to compute the pixel values is saved in the CFCache.
        This is typically used to first construct a blank CFCache,
        which can then be filled in parallel with the appropriate
        settings of the cflist, pa, and dpa values.

        mode=fillcf is used to fill the CFs specified in the cflist
        based on the settings of the pa and dpa parameters.


%%A cflist (default=)

	List of CFs to be filled for mode=fillcf based on the setting
	of the pa and dpa parameters.
