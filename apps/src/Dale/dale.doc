        An application to normalized images.

        This app looks for the word "normalized" in the
	image subType string to determine if the images
	(.psf, .weight, .residual, .model) are already
	normalized.  Absence of an exact match for the
	word "normalized" is interpreted as un-normalized
	image.

%%A imagename (default=)

	Name of the image to be normalized.  If a name
	without extension is given, the imtype (see below)
	will be used as the name extension.

%%A imtype (default=psf) Options:[ psf residual model]

	Watched keywords (<VALUE> : <Keywords exposed>):
          model : weightimage sowimage 
          residual : weightimage sowimage 

	The type of the input image supplied via the imagename
	keyword.

%%A weightimage (default=)

	The name of the weight image.  This is required
	for normalizing residual and model images.

        If no name is given, a name is generated with the
	basename derived from the imagename keyword and
	extension ".weight".

%%A sowimage (default=)

	The name of the sum-of-weights image.  This is
	required for normalizing residual and model images.

        If no name is given, a name is generated with the
	basename derived from the imagename keyword and
	extension ".sumwt".

%%A pblimit (default=0.2)

	The PB limit used when normalizing residual and model
	images.  Pixels beyond the this value of the PB are
	set to 0.0.

%%A computepb (default=0)

	If set to true, also compute the .pb image as sqrt(weightimage)
	with the peak normalized to unity.

%%A normalizeweight (default=1)

	This is currently ineffective.  We don't need to normalize this
	image.  If a need is found, we should explicitly normalize it via
	a new imtype=weight.

        If set to true, normalize the weight image on the disk by the
	sum of weights when imtype=psf.  This is a side-effect that seems
	unnecessary.
